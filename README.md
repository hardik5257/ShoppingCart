# ShoppingCart

1. This project basically calcualtes final Cart price based on promotion applied to cart.
2. Cart.java is a main class contains main method. In which products and coupons can be configured in it.
3. I have used 2 promotions mentioned in pdf file and wrote my code according to it.
4. One assumtion I have made for this is, If more than One promotions are being used in the cart then the final total cart prize will be calculated based on whichever total amount is lesser after applying each promotion.
5. "shopping.cart.test" package has 2 test files which cover most of the test scenarios.
